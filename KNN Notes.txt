** K Nearest Neighbors ** 

KNN is a classification algorithm that operates on a very simple principle.

*Training Algorithm*
1. Store all the data

*Prediction Algorithm*
1. Calculate the distance from x to all points in your data
2. Sort the points in your data by increasing distance from x
3. Predict the majority label of the 'K' closest points

- Very Simple
- Training is trivial
- Works with any number of classes
- Easy to add more data
- Few parameters
	- K
